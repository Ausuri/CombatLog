Hurg says:

adrian@rudnik24.de says:
heh i hope so   just send you a second mail asking for a compiled binary, because i havent vs right on this machine
Hurg says:

adrian@rudnik24.de says:
made any other game tools? or your first for a online game?
Hurg says:
I've got a few more EVE related tools that r not really ready for distribution atm. The only other game related thing I've done in the past was a character stats tracker for Planetside
adrian@rudnik24.de says:
oh   how comes a planetsider comes to eve?
Hurg says:
heh, I gave up PlanetSide a _long_ time ago. Shortly after it went live actually. I was in the beta test and was throughly bored and frustrated a month into go-live
adrian@rudnik24.de says:
hmm never played it, though dancer told me it had much potential... just to loose it with all same things over and over again.
Hurg says:
yep, it suffered from two big problems, level grind and repitition... the huge battle for territory never changed... ever. But, to this day, I've still had some of my most memorable team playing experiences with it..
adrian@rudnik24.de says:
the idea was nice... well... 2 forums are ready, just assigning the moderation rights to it
Hurg says:

adrian@rudnik24.de says:
hmmm damn, its soooo long ago i created ftp accounts *g*
Hurg says:
 
adrian@rudnik24.de says:

adrian@rudnik24.de says:
when the post is ready, give me a tell
Hurg says:
will do. it'll take me a couple of mins to come up with some appropriate words  
adrian@rudnik24.de says:
no problem, maybe you get a working ftp account as reward *lol*
Hurg says:
lol
adrian@rudnik24.de says:
you need any eve-i.com email adress?
Hurg says:
would be useful, yes
adrian@rudnik24.de says:
just forwarding or pop3?
Hurg says:
pop3 if that's ok
adrian@rudnik24.de says:
need to recheck, but i guess it would be okay... just dont send large files over it *g*
Hurg says:
rgr  
Hurg says:
I have a question for u..
adrian@rudnik24.de says:
oh and there is something you could help me with. a direct link to the microsoft downloadpage for the .net files, where users can download the latest version
adrian@rudnik24.de says:
sure whats up
Hurg says:
yes, link to .NET coming up in a min  
adrian@rudnik24.de says:
pop3 and smtp server:  eve-i.com
adrian@rudnik24.de says:
username:  web6p5
Hurg says:
I want to give people a link to the overview page in the Looking for beta testers post. I can point them at my own site but am worried about my limited bandwidth. r u planning on putting that page onthe eve-i site? If so, do u have the link?
adrian@rudnik24.de says:
that page goes up and will get his own point in the navigation   you can upload and download the site and files... as islay does
adrian@rudnik24.de says:
so you use our bandwith. you know how to operate ftp?
adrian@rudnik24.de says:
mail password: 66hurgeve
Hurg says:
ftp, yes, I've used it b4  
adrian@rudnik24.de says:
emailadress: hurg@eve-i.com
Hurg says:
got it
adrian@rudnik24.de says:
be sure to enable md5 or no encryption for smtp, but you need to pop3 before smtp
adrian@rudnik24.de says:
otherwise you get a relay denied
Hurg says:
rgr
Hurg says:
just looking for .Net framework download link...
adrian@rudnik24.de says:
you can read emails through web here: https://confixx.p15135288.pureserver.info/user
adrian@rudnik24.de says:
just use username and pass. you can also configure autoresponder there
Hurg says:
cool  
adrian@rudnik24.de says:
hmmm okay... rechecking ftp now
adrian@rudnik24.de says:
ftp ready
Hurg says:
rgr
adrian@rudnik24.de says:
server: eve-i.com
port: 21
username: web6f7
passwort is the same as email
adrian@rudnik24.de says:
login will get you the directory content of http://www.eve-i.com/home/hurg
adrian@rudnik24.de says:
you can use your own php scripts there
adrian@rudnik24.de says:
to count downloads and so on if you wish
Hurg says:
hmm, maybe l8r on I'll think about d/l counters
Hurg says:
trying ftp login now
adrian@rudnik24.de says:
you may ask islay, as he has some scripts already for it
adrian@rudnik24.de says:
you can upload the binary there
Hurg says:
good idea, thx..
Hurg says:
ftp login works  
Hurg says:
finally found a link to the .NET Framework download page too  
adrian@rudnik24.de says:
cool   will need to put it somewhere in the news and on the download page as link
Hurg says:
ok. Give me a few minutes to digest all of this and sort myself out.
Hurg says:
news article would be very cool   
adrian@rudnik24.de says:
i will put site templates with the content of your current homepage online, as soon as i can get them ready. you can then download them and you will see how you can alter the content directly on the eve-i.com homepage
Hurg says:
rgr that
Hurg says:
hey, can I send u an installer to try?
adrian@rudnik24.de says:
sure. just upload it... i can directly download it from there  
Hurg says:
cool. give me a sec to u/l it
adrian@rudnik24.de says:
you need to upload new versions and beta versions yourself. though i advise you to keep about 5-6 old versions on the server and use numering the file names for the installer. also provide alternative zip files for easy updates, not using the installer again
Hurg says:
That all seems very sensible. Will do
Hurg says:
hmm, the installer binary is 744K. I'll look at reducing that
Hurg says:
it's also a Microsoft MSI install file atm, I'll change that to a standard Setup.exe
Hurg says:
it's there now  
adrian@rudnik24.de says:
doh *g* yeah would be better to make an exe of it. if its an msi, we need an download link for the most recent version of the windows installer service for win98 to winxp  
Hurg says:
yep
Hurg says:
my thoughts exactly
Hurg says:
just a build switch in vs so no problem (I hope)
adrian@rudnik24.de says:
tried also msi first, but i went to rar... just doesnt need that much of requirements
Hurg says:
if I have problems with a setup.exe I'll look into a rar sfx
adrian@rudnik24.de says:
oh and something else
Hurg says:
go ahead
adrian@rudnik24.de says:
you know upx?
Hurg says:
nope
Hurg says:
ah, exe packer
Hurg says:
remember now
adrian@rudnik24.de says:
upx is an exe packer. not for the setup.exe, but for your main exe
adrian@rudnik24.de says:
http://upx.sourceforge.net/
Hurg says:
not sure how well it works with .net exe's but will check
adrian@rudnik24.de says:
just an idea... dunno if it works with .nets
Hurg says:
just looking at it now..
adrian@rudnik24.de says:
okay, installer installs fine on a normal, non vs, system with latest .net 1.1
Hurg says:
excellent. that's a good start
adrian@rudnik24.de says:
app also works
Hurg says:
btw, startup time on first run will take a while with lots of gamelogs. Everything gets cached so subsequent start-ups r a lot quicker
adrian@rudnik24.de says:
yeah just noticed... but im aware of it  =
Hurg says:
I may add an info dialog for "First time running" cases
adrian@rudnik24.de says:
you might put it into the readme... 2-3 third line or so   users can be so... shy *g*
Hurg says:
 
Hurg says:
upx doesn't work
Hurg says:
with .net binaries
adrian@rudnik24.de says:
damn... well... *g*
Hurg says:
no problem.. I'm going afk for about 10 mins now. Got some rl stuff to do. Will talk when I get back
adrian@rudnik24.de says:
k
adrian@rudnik24.de says:
will create the homepage meanwhile
adrian@rudnik24.de says:
will also need to recompress and resize the images
Hurg says:
back
Hurg says:
images.. ok. let me know the required dimensions and I'll resize
adrian@rudnik24.de says:
just resizing currently   almost finished... meanwhile, take a look at your homepage
adrian@rudnik24.de says:
just look in the tools navigation left on eve-i.com
Hurg says:
cool    
Hurg says:
some Char Manager bits need removing obviously but it's looking very cool indeed  
adrian@rudnik24.de says:
yeah... working on it right now  
adrian@rudnik24.de says:
oh and thanks for the great work youve done before... makes it easy to implement  
Hurg says:
no need to thank me. I wanted to make it as easy as possible for u guys to agree to host it  
Hurg says:
regarding the installer, Visual Studio will not create a setup.exe style installer. However, the msi it generates includes the latest version of the msi installer package so no additional downloads necessary
Hurg says:
first time I've come across that..
adrian@rudnik24.de says:
hmmm
adrian@rudnik24.de says:
well lets hope everyone can execute msi files i guess :/

Hurg says:
yep. According to the VS documentation, the msi executable it generates includes a bootstrap that will install the necessary MSI bits before the installation begins so if it works as it says it does, it shouldn't be a problem
Hurg says:
/me crosses fingers...  
adrian@rudnik24.de says:
okay   can you upload the current msi again? avoid case sensitive names... its still just a linux machine  

Hurg says:
will do, I'll shorten the filename too
