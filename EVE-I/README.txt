EVE Combat Log Analyser 0.01 README - 12/Aug/2004
=================================================

Requirements
============

First things first, do you have the Microsoft .NET Framework installed? If not, you'll need to download and install it before doing anything else, here are a couple of links:

Microsoft .NET Framework Home Page     - http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/technologyinfo/default.aspx
Download the Microsoft .NET Framework  - http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/downloads/framework1_1/

All done, excellent, time to move on.


About EVE Combat Log Analyser
=============================

The EVE Combat Log Analyser (CLA) was written with a single purpose in mind, to provide me with easy means of analysing my EVE combat logs, in particular, how much damage I'm doing, to whom and when. Rather than trawling through lots of badly formatted plain text, why not take a look at the official CLA home page, it's even got pictures :) http://www.eve-i.com/home/hurg/page/page_cla.php


Bugs / Suggestions
==================

All feedback is welcome as long as it's vagualy constructive. Please use the forums (link at the bottom of the home page) or email me directly at hurg@eve-i.com.


Terms and Conditions
====================

The CLA is free. I neither ask for nor expect payment of any kind (come to think of it, I'm not completely convinced that anyone would pay if I did). If you do feel a desperate urge to bestow gifts or tokens of gratitude on me, just wire some ISK or escrow some cool bp's to 'Hurg' in-game :)

Third Party Components
======================

The CLA uses the rather wonderful SandDock and SandBar .NET components from www.divil.co.uk. If you are a .NET developer you really should check them out. Not only are they excellent components but they are also completely free of charge for non-commercial use. See http://www.divil.co.uk/net/purchase/default.aspx for licensing information.
