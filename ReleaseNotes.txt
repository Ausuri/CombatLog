EVE Combat Log Analyser
=======================

Version 0.17 24/November/2009
=============================
+ Can now read Apocrypha Logs. But most of the colored logs indicating the Hit type is have now disapeared since there is no information on the Log.
+ Closing the program on the exit option was not closing it.


Version 0.16 28/November/2006
=============================

+ Can now view (notify) messages in the main log view. Useful sometimes to if you were being scrambled etc. New checkbox added to the log view to enable/disable this feature.
+ <color> tags are now removed from exported line entries
+ Problem with &lt;&gt; encoding fixed.

Version 0.15 29/September/2006
==============================

+ Added the ability to attach player notes to combat logs

Version 0.14 6/April/2006
=========================

+ Resumption of work on CLA begins... again
+ No major changes, other than starting to play with potentially useful damage graphs
- Current build still has references to EVE-I website which died long ago so auto-update etc. doesn't work.


Version 0.13 20/December/2004
=============================

+ Resumption of work on CLA begins!
+ Fixed Null reference exception when running the Best Shots report


Version 0.12 04/October/2004
============================

+ Best Shots Report: User Filtering overhauled* (see footnote)

+ Bug Fix: When using the Clear Cache option, the application now automatically quits. This side steps issues of the in-memory cache not being cleared correctly. [reported by EvilGriff, Fuseblown and Hairy Al]
+ Bug Fix: Using the "Weapon Info..." context menu no longer causes the app to blow up [reported by me]
+ Bug Fix: Doesn't blow up anymore when opening a log file where the file size has grown since it was first cached [reported by turrican]

* It would take far too long to explain in detail what has been changed suffice to say that it's behaviour when using filters makes more sense now. In a nutshell, the Best Shots list is now generated based on the subset of log files that are available after the user filters have been applied. Previously, the Best Shots were generated from all log files and that list was subsequently reduced by applying user filters. 1 Million ISK to the first person to give me an actual example where this is important.


Version 0.11 01/October/2004
============================

New month, new release...

+ Weapon Browser columns are now configurable i.e. can be individually toggled on or off (right click on any column heading)
+ Added "Save As HTML" option to the Weapon Data Browser
+ Added "Save As CSV" option to the Weapon Browser
+ Weapon Name column in Weapon Browser locked so Name field is always visible when scrolling a large grid horizontally.
+ Bug Fix: Missing Log Dir names problem fixed
+ Bug Fix: Options dialog refusing to close fixed
+ Bug Fix: Startup Version Check failure fixed
+ Bug Fix: Proxy problems (use browser settings + authenticated proxy) fixed - probably


Version 0.10 28/September/2004
==============================

+ Web proxy support added - new Options panel added for proxy configuration
+ The "Weapon Info" option (context menu in My Victims and My Attackers windows) now uses the internal Weapons Browser
+ Bug Fix: Was not recognising logs where player fired no shots but was attacked
+ Bug Fix: Rescan not anchored properly. Positioning broken when Filebrowser pane was resized
+ Bug Fix: Some users (well, one) reported receiving an error (in Form2_Resize) when opening a log file. This has been trapped properly now but should never occur anyway
+ Bug Fix: Dragging combat entries from the My Attackers window wasn't implemented.


Version 0.09 23/September/2004
==============================

+ Bug Fix: Weapon data parser was not locale indendent.
+ Bug Fix: Weapon/Target info fixed. Crowley changed the format of the EVE-I search results page and I didn't notice.
+ Bug Fix: Weapon Browser: Search option only worked when search strings were lower case
+ Bug Fix: Weapon Browser: Filters and Search text are no longer cleared if the the search finds 0 results.


Version 0.08 22/September/2004
==============================

+ Offline Weapon data browser implemented using data from the EVE-I Object Explorer - includes ability to view weapons by Type and Ship Class and also allows free text searching.
+ Weapon Class and Type filters added to File Browser and "Best Shots" report
+ Saving and restoring Window Layouts/Column Widths have been turned into configurable options (See Tools->Options dialog).
+ Progressbar no longer always visible. Only appears now when needed.
+ Bug Fix: Fixed problem with parsing incoming drone attack data.
+ Bug Fix: Sort by Damage value was slightly broken in Victim / Attacker lists.
+ Bug Fix: Export as CSV was broken in previous release, always attempted to export Attack data only.
+ Bug Fix: Taskbar icon was not re-appearing after application was minimised to the system tray.
+ Bug Fix: Removed scroll bar from Options tree view panel.
+ Bug Fix: Problems launching email/web browser from the links on About box are now trapped and reported properly. Still don't know how to launch a Firefox/Mozilla browser window though.

Version 0.07 - Not released
===========================

Various internal code changes. No functional or UI updates.


Version 0.061 07/September/2004
===============================

+ Attacker data analysis implemented
+ Analysis window split into multiple tabs to support attack data
+ Application now remembers and restores page layout - Includes Docking windows and column sixe and positions for all of the lists
+ Summary panels now auto-resize so information will always be visible
+ Ditched the location info tab, took up to much space and didn't add much value. Current location is now shown instead in the log window title bar.
+ Sorting by HitType column in all list views now sorts by hit type rank/priority rather than hit type name i.e Wrecking has a higher rank than Excellent etc.


Version 0.06 06/September/2004
==============================

+ Auto-detection of new log files implemented along with funky fading window user notification option.
+ Filter drop down lists (Character, Log Dir, Weapon and Target) are now constrained by other filter selections i.e. Selecting Weapon type X will mean that the target list will only contain entries where Weapon type X was used.
+ Web based version checker introduced.
+ Option to minimize application to the System Tray.
+ Cache Diagnostics Report added.
+ Option to clear the cache added (Pretty much a debugging aid in case of suspected cache corruption).
+ Target names containing dots (aka periods aka full stops) were causing the parser problems. Now fixed.


Version 0.05 25/August/2004
===========================

+ Massive (and this time I really mean it) reduction in startup times

+ Added Filter By Target and Filter By Weapon options to the File Browser (very cool feature, should have done it earlier)

+ Minor bug fix. Summary stats ignoring filters (weapon, target, damage type) when user selected some combat entries then cleared the selection.


Version 0.04 24/August/2004
===========================

+ Return key in "Add Folder" now OK's the dialog.

+ Fixed bug with Hit Type analysis data breaking once filters were applied.

+ Scroll bars now appear when necessary in Graph panel

+ Total Average Damage value was calculated incorrectly, fixed now.

+ Location information now displayed (Not completely reliable as it is dependent on the right information being available in the log files. The application does it's best however to sniff out any "travel" related messages in the log being analysed, if none are found, it regresses back through a number (max 5) of preceding files until it does find location messages.

+ Fixed bug in the filebrowser which caused filesystem dates (instead of the Session Created date from the log file) to be displayed in the Date column. This meant log files could end up in the wrong order if the log files had been copied/moved (or otherwise "touched" by filing system).

+ Stats can now be calculated on user selections of log file entries i.e. selecting multiple entries log entries will result in all stats being re-calculated for that selection. Useful if you want a quick view of just a handful of entries. (Easier to use than it is to explain :) )

+ Status bar now gives more information during start-up phase

+ Minor UI bug (bottom of listview obscured by Log Text window) in Best Shots Report fixed

+ Added a Shots Per Min Column to the summary report (if anything shows up EVE's tendency to not log data properly, this is it. Expect to see weird numbers here).


Version 0.03 22/August/2004
===========================

Bug Fix

Hit Type Summary no longer disappears when filters are applied to analysis data.


Version 0.02 22/August/2004
===========================

Changes

+ The application no longer attempts to locate the EVE installation directory from the registry entry so all Log Dir paths must be configured manually!

Enhancements

+ Start up time for both cache creation and cache load significantly reduced

+ All Time Best Shot Report implemented (See Reports menu)

	Showing best shot by Weapon by Character by Log Directory
		+ Can cope with multiple characters on multiple servers (Tranq, Chaos etc.) e.g. Heavy Beam Laser for Hurg on Tranq vs. Heavy Beam Laser for <Alt name> on Tranq vs. Heavy Beam Laser for Hurg on Chaos
		+ Sortable by any column
		+ Individual entries or a selection of entries can be exported using Drag and Drop of Right-Click->Copy Log Text context menu
		
+ Weapon Summary List (bottom of analysis window) now includes:
    Duration (how long the weapon was active)
    DoT (Damage Over Time) Summary
	Double clicking a Weapon will filter the main analysis window by that Weapon

+ Main log window list is now sortable by any column

+ Log entries can be dragged from the main log window into a text editor (copying the original log file entry)

+ Log entries can be copied to the clipboard (for pasting into EVE Chat windows) using Right Click->Copy Log Text option

+ Damage By Hit Type Graphs now a little better at dealing with widths (still needs a lot of luvin tho)

+ Summary Description Panel now gives a well formatted damage by Hit Type break down showing for each hit type
	Hits per hit type
	Hits percentage per hit type
	Damage per hit type
	Damage percentage per hit type

+ Help menu now includes some other useful links

+ About Box -> Version number now a bit more useful, includes build and revision numbers

+ Log file generated (in the application installation directory) to aid future bug tracking. Log file is reset on application startup.

+ An absolute ton of internal data changes


Version 0.01e 14/August/2004
============================

Minor maintenance release.

Fixes

+ Yet another startup bug found (invalid directory path associated with EVE installation registry key).
+ Added some debug output to help track down future problems. Look in Program Files\Combat Log Analyser\DEBUG_LOG.log. The file can get quite big but is cleared on startup so shouldn't be a problem.


Version 0.01d 13/August/2004
============================

Minor maintenance release.

Fixes

+ No longer hangs on startup when the EVE registry key does not exist.
+ File.IO error messages when closing the Options dialog fixed.

============================

Fixes

+ Fix for the "all damage values appearing as 0.0"/"all damage values increased by a factor of 10"
+ Fix for the "unable to find EVE installation" crash on startup
+ Target names including the word "completely" have been fixed i.e. "Sansha's Minion completely" will no longer appear

Enhancements

+ Options dialog box

	Now possible to configure CLA to look in several user specified locations for gamelogs
	New column added to File Browser window to show which location the log file is from
	New Filter Option added to File Browser - Filter By Location
